# Overview

The [npm API](https://npmjs.org) provides developers and users with access to a comprehensive set of tools for creating and managing JavaScript-based applications. It is a powerful tool for building, distributing, testing, and maintaining all sorts of applications, from web and mobile applications to the cloud.

With the npm API, developers have access to a library of code, modules, packages, and services that they can use to build robust applications. From popular JavaScript libraries to web frameworks such as React, Vue.js and Angular, to web development tools such as Gulp and Grunt, npm's APIs provide a wealth of possibilities for any type of application.

Using npm, applications can be easily automated using a wide variety of tools, such as npm run-scripts, Grunt, and Gulp. Additionally, developers can use the npm registry service to search and download popular packages from the Node.js registry, as well as build and deploy applications from the command line.

Here are some examples of the types of applications developers can build with the npm API:

- Command-line applications
- Web applications
- Mobile applications
- Cross-platform applications
- Graphical user interface applications
- Machine learning applications
- Desktop applications
- Application servers
- Database applications
