# Overview

The Node API on Pipedream allows you to automate and integrate data from many sources.  It provides an easy way to write code in a serverless environment, so you don't need to set up a server or a database. With the Node API, you can quickly build, deploy and manage operations and data pipelines.

Here are just some examples of what you can build using the Node API:

- Automate and integrate data from databases and APIs
- Create complex data pipelines
- Implement serverless functions to process events and data
- Analyze data in real time
- Build customer journeys and workflows
- Trigger notifications based on user behavior or data changes
- Construct custom analytics dashboards and reports
